## How to Approach Complex Projects
The last few projects have given you an opportunity to work within an existing codebase to either improve the code or add new features. This final project is different: *You will build this project from scratch, without any existing starter code to rely on.*

Starting from nothing gives you a significant amount of freedom to make your own design decisions. However, it can also be really intimidating to begin such an open-ended project. Let's break down one way to think about and work through building your map application. This is not the only strategy, and you may find that you work better under a different process.

### First steps
1. Make sure you clearly understand the requirements of the project. Make a note of anything you’re not sure how you’re going to complete.
1. Draw a diagram of what your completed application might look like. You may need to draw out a couple of different versions, depending on the behavior you’re trying to implement.
1. Break your diagram into a structure of React components. What parts of the application seem to make sense as components? How small should your components be?
1. Research a few candidates for third-party API integrations and decide which one makes the most sense for your project.
1. Obtain developer credentials for Google Maps (and your chosen API, if required).
1. Before you start building your application, test the API and build a basic Google Map. You’ll want to make sure you understand how to query your chosen API and to successfully receive JSON data from the response. You’ll also want to make sure that you understand how the Google Maps JavaScript API works and be able to initialize a map and add map markers to it without using React.
1. The last step before you start building will be to research how you can use Google Maps in a React project. There is no one right way to do this. There are several approaches that will work. As a professional web developer, you will often be asked to solve a problem that requires finding a solution on your own.

### Start building
1. **Commit early, commit often**. Use Git to track your work and maintain a record of your progress. You’ll never know when you might need to backtrack and try something new, and it’s nice to not have to start over from the beginning.
1. **Build one thing at a time**. Pick a component to start with, and build it. Make sure it works, then build the next one.
1. **First, make it work. Then make it better**. Don’t worry too much about writing perfect code the first time. Your first goal is to get each piece of your project functioning. Once you’ve done that, you can start to focus on improving the code quality and making sure that everything works well together.

### Community Resources
We have designed this project to be challenging. It will stretch your skills and there will likely be moments when you find yourself struggling to make things work the way you want them to. Remember that you have a lot of options to work through these challenges and *you are not alone in this journey!.*

* The [Slack community](https://fend.slack.com/) for FEND
  * You are not alone. If you have questions, concerns or frustrations, feel free to share them with your colleagues. Someone else might have a solution for you, or some thoughts about a strategy you haven’t considered.
* [Knowledge](https://knowledge.udacity.com/)
  * Udacity's proprietary search-based learning platform for asked and answered questions. As you work through projects you will encounter many of the same challenges your classmates have. If you have a question, search for it here. If you don't see it, ask it here. If you have an answer, share it here (and build up your stats). In a hurry for a deadline - you can filter by project and get the FAQ. Knowledge is a powerful platform for making rapid progress in your Nanodegree program and helping other students!
* Your **Study Group**
  * Along with fellow students, each room also includes mentors who are certified to review that project and available to help you and your peers prior to submitting your projects for review. You will find a community of students and mentors online from around the world, helping and pushing each other towards graduation.

The internet is full of helpful resources as well:

1. [StackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com/) is a great question and answer site for developers. There’s a good chance that someone has already asked your question there, and, if not, you can ask it yourself!
2. There’s nothing wrong with using Google to search articles or blogs for help.

## Academic Integrity
Remember that the goal of this project is for you to find solutions to challenging problems and implement them in your project code. If you use resources like StackOverflow answers, blogs or articles, be sure to cite them with comments in your code.

We expect you to do your own work as you build this project. Avoid using code from other student projects or open-source projects to build your application, even with citation. You’ve worked really hard to get to this point. You can do this!
