## Project Submission
You will develop a single-page application using React featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a list view to support simple browsing of all locations. You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).

## Evaluation
Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to the [Neighborhood Map (React) Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1351/view). Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.

## Submission
1. The node_modules directory may contain thousands of files and should not be contained in the submission. If your project code is on GitHub, you may need to remove tracking from these files (and remove them from your repository) before submitting.
1. Your project *must* include a README with clear instructions for setting up and running your project application code.
1. The master branch is the default Github repository branch. If you wish to submit another branch, you'll need to set it as the [new default branch](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-the-default-branch/) inside your Github repository.
Due to the high volume of submissions we receive, please allow up up to **7 business days** for your evaluation to be returned.
If you are having any problems submitting your project, please [contact Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/contact).
