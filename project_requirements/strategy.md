REMINDER: Place new entries at the TOP of this doc!

Another complete refresh. Goal is to do all of this offline - I get too carried away by my ideas!

Right so I am (as usual) making this more difficult than it needs to be.
Foursquare API. Coffee Shops. (MAYBE insert filter to omit all Starbucks). Boom. Graduate (I hope!)

I am going to look at a select group of places called "free date ideas" in the San Antonio, TX area. This allows me to /\[fairly] easily reuse Lessons 7 and 8 from Part 5 by converting it into a react app.

My intitial thoughts are to use the html doc from the 'getting started with APIs' lesson and parse the functions into components then an app using React.

To give more details, I also need to pull in another non-google api/library. Would love to use wikipedia since we actually donate there regularly.

Then, I need to set up a Service Worker. Hoping the code from my restaurant reviews project will suffice with minor tweaking.
