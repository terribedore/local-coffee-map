## Project Overview
You will develop a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

## Why this Project?
The neighborhood map application is complex enough and incorporates a variety of data points that it can easily become unwieldy to manage. There are a number of frameworks, libraries and APIs available to make this process more manageable and many employers are looking for specific skills in using these packages.

## What will I Learn?
You will learn how design patterns and UI libraries like React assist in developing a manageable codebase. You’ll then explore how frameworks can decrease the time required developing an application and provide a number of utilities for you to use. Finally, you’ll implement third-party APIs that provide valuable data sets that can improve the quality of your application.

## How does this help my Career?
* React is an in-demand technology for Front-End Web Developers
* Interacting with API servers is the primary function of Front-End Web Developers
* Use of third-party libraries and APIs is a standard and acceptable practice that is encouraged
* Asynchronous programming is important to understand in today's market
