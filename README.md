Special Thanks to my mentor and spouse, [Eric Andersen](https://github.com/chiveturkey) and to the inestimable Forrest Walker for his Youtube Walkthrough on integrating a non-google api (aka Four Square).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and integrates [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) with [FourSquare Place API](https://developer.foursquare.com/places-api).
