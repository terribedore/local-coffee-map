## Installation

To get started right away:

* download or clone this repo.
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

NOTE: There is a Service Worker enabled. It only works in production mode. This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives it offline capabilities. However, it also means that developers (and users) will only see deployed updates on subsequent visits to a page, after all the existing tabs open on the page have been closed, since previously cached resources are updated in the background. BE SURE TO CLOSE DOWN THE LOCAL SERVER OCCASIONALLY FOR UPDATES AND CHANGES. (you do so by closing terminal window)


## Usage

## Credits
Special Thanks to my mentor and spouse, [Eric Andersen](https://github.com/chiveturkey) and to the inestimable Forrest Walker for his Youtube Walkthrough on integrating a non-google api (aka Four Square).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and integrates [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) with [FourSquare Place API](https://developer.foursquare.com/places-api).
